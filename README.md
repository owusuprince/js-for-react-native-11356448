This repository contains three JavaScript files that demonstrate different programming concepts.

arrayManipulation.js.....................................

This file contains two functions: processArray and formatArrayStrings. The processArray function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with each number modified according to a specific rule (even numbers are squared, odd numbers are tripled). The formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays as input (an array of strings and an array of numbers) and returns a new array of strings, where each string is formatted according to the corresponding number in the second array (even numbers result in uppercase strings, odd numbers result in lowercase strings).

userInfo.js.............................................

This file contains a single function: createUserProfiles. The function takes two arrays as input (an array of original names and an array of modified names) and returns an array of user profile objects. Each object contains the original name, modified name, and a unique ID.
